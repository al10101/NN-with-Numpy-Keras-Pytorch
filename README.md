# NN-with-Numpy-Keras-Pytorch

This repository contains code to train and use a neural network that predicts the value of numbers from images of handwritten numbers. I wrote 3 ways to train the neural network:

- [!Numpy](https://numpy.org): Package to implement a range variety of mathematical functions. As it does not have modules to make neural networks, this method consists of programming all the algorithms from scratch.

- [!Keras](https://keras.io): Specialized API for methods used in AI.

- [!Pytorch](https://pytorch.org): Specialized framework for methods used in AI.

Since the purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference to learn how classification neural networks work from different approaches, all codes commited here are commented as much as possible.Therefore, the codes are not generalized for every problem and may not be fully optimized. Again, the purpose of the repository is purely educational.
